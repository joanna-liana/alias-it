# 🏡 Alias it!

A utility tool for creating shell aliases.

Written in GO just for fun.

## Usage

Grab your `alias-it` binary from [the Releases page](https://github.com/joanna-liana/alias-it/releases), then use it by running:

```
alias-it <alias_name> <command_name>
```

## Supported shells

For now - only `zsh`.
